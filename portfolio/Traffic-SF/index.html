        Vision Zero initiative, the city continues to has dozens of traffic-related fatalities
        occurring annually. (Edison Wu)

      In 2014, San Francisco set an ambitious goal: eliminate all traffic-related deaths by 2024
      under the Vision Zero initiative. The city committed millions to improving road safety by
      redesigning dangerous intersections, lowering speed limits, and prioritizing pedestrian and
      cyclist safety. But a decade later, the city is far from reaching that goal. Traffic
      fatalities have remained persistently high, putting the plan’s effectiveness under scrutiny.
    </p>
    <h3>A Grim Reality</h3>
    <p>
      San Francisco recorded over 45 traffic-related deaths in 2023, surpassing the number of
      fatalities in 2014 when the program was launched. Early success saw fatalities drop to 20 in
      2017, but the recent rise has residents questioning whether the current approach is enough to
      meet the original target.

      The map of fatal crashes reveals that these incidents are spread across the city, with several
      occurring near roads flagged as part of the "high-injury network," where the majority of
      severe traffic crashes happen. For those living in these areas, navigating daily commutes
      feels perilous, with dangerous intersections and speeding vehicles a constant threat.
    </p>
    <h3>Pedestrians Are the Main Victims</h3>

    <p>
      The data shows pedestrians continue to be disproportionately affected, accounting for nearly
      half of all traffic deaths. High-speed crashes involving motorcyclists and drivers also
      contribute significantly to the rising fatality count.

    <p>
      With the 2024 Vision Zero deadline fast approaching, it’s evident that much more needs to be
      done. Dangerous driving behaviors, particularly speeding, have worsened during and after the
      COVID-19 pandemic. In response, Mayor London Breed announced new measures in 2023 to improve
      road safety, such as expanding the ban on right turns at red lights, increasing police
      presence at high-risk intersections, and installing more speed cameras.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, enforcement has been a significant challenge. Traffic citations in San Francisco have
      plummeted in recent years. In 2014, officers issued more than 10,000 citations per month, but
      by 2023, that number had dropped to fewer than 350 citations monthly—a 96% decrease. This
      sharp decline in enforcement, which began even before the pandemic, raises concerns about the
      city’s ability to ensure safer streets.
    </p>
    <h3>The Road Ahead</h3>
    <p class="last-p">
      As San Francisco moves into the next phase of Vision Zero, the central question remains: Will
      these new measures be enough to reverse the trend and make the city’s streets safer? The
      reality is, the path forward is far more complex than city officials may have anticipated a
      decade ago.
